I am a senior bachelor student of Computer Engineering at the [Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en) of [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/) in Iran. I was an NLP Research Assistant and AI Developer at [CommentMiner](http://commentminer.com/) (2017-2018), and an NLP Research Assistant at the [Department of Computer Engineering of Sharif University of Technology](http://ce.sharif.edu/) under supervision of [Dr. Mohammad Hadi Bokaei](http://ce.sharif.edu/~bokaei/).

I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Specificly, I am curious about deep learning approaches to generate text of natural language and create agents that are able to chat with people. Some topics in Computer Vision are also intriguing to me: GAN's and their application in generating images.
