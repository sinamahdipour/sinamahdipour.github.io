I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student and research assistant at [Colorado State University (CSU)](https://www.colostate.edu). I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from the [Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en) of [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/). Prior to CSU, I was at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas for one year earning experience on both teaching and research. Also, I had been an NLP Research Assistant and AI Developer at [CommentMiner](http://www.commentminer.ir/) (2017-2018).

I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning approaches to analyze natural language text.
