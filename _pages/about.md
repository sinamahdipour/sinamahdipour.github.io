I am a senior bachelor student of Computer Engineering at the department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology of Amirkabir University of Technology in Iran. I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Specificly, I am curious about deep learning approaches to generate text of natural language and create agents that are able to chat with us. Some topics in Computer Vision are also intriguing to me: GAN's and their application in generating fake images.
