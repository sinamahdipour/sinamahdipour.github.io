I am a Computer Science Ph.D. Student at [University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV)](https://www.unlv.edu); also, I am working as a Graduate Research Assistant at [Howard R. Hughes College of Engineering](https://www.unlv.edu/engineering) at UNLV. I received my B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering from the [Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology](http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/home.htm?depurl=computer-engineering&lang=en) of [Amirkabir University of Technology](http://aut.ac.ir/aut/) in Iran. Also, I was an NLP Research Assistant and AI Developer at [CommentMiner](http://www.commentminer.ir/) (2017-2018).

I am interested in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Specificly, I am curious about machine learning approaches to generate and analyze text of natural language to create high-end chat-bots.
